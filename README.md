# TravelBucketlistFrontend

This is the frontend of my Pet project. The app's name is Travel Bucket List. You can add new destinations where you would like to go in your life.


After you visited the place, you can set the destination to visited, and from now on you can find the destination at the Visited Destinations. You can also set the date from and until, when you have visited the place.


The project was made with Angular. The backend is java spring boot. I used bootstrap for the design. Apart from this, the whole design of the page was created by me.
